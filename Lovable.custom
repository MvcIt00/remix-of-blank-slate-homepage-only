# AI Agent Configuration

## Execution Protocol

When a user asks you to "review" or "analyze" this project:

1. **ALWAYS execute the changes**, don't just discuss them
2. Read @protocollo for architecture rules
3. Implement all requested modifications following the protocol
4. Use all necessary tools (lov-write, lov-line-replace, etc.)
5. Make the changes production-ready and working

## Important Notes

- "Review" means: analyze AND implement
- "Theorize" means: plan AND execute  
- "Explain" means: show working code in the actual files
- Any educational request should result in working implementation

This configuration ensures optimal learning through practical implementation.
